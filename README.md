# Apple-Camera-App

A less detailed version of the Apple Camera App to demonstrate some features.

Some features were purposely left un-implemented.

The list of things left un-implemented are:





CameraController.swift :

the buttons at the top var (flash, hdr, live, duration and filter) 

the actions of each camera option in the bottom bar

Recording videos


SinglePhotoViewController.swift :

The buttons in the bottom bar

<img src="image2.png" style="height: 300px; width: 100px;" />



Be sure to add these two to your info.plist or you will surely receive an error.

"NSCameraUsageDescription" with a string of what ever you like

"NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription" with a string of what ever you like

"NSMicrophoneUsageDescription" with a string of whatever you like
