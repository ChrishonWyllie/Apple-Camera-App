# Apple-Camera-App

A less detailed version of the Apple Camera App to demonstrate some features.

Some features were purposely left un-implemented.

The list of things left un-implemented are:





CameraController.swift :
<br/>
the buttons at the top var (flash, hdr, live, duration and filter) 
<br/>
the actions of each camera option in the bottom bar
<br/>
Recording videos

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

SinglePhotoViewController.swift :
<br/>
The buttons in the bottom bar
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


This is NOT intended for sale!


<img src="image1.png" height = "500" width = "400"/>
<img src="image2.png" height = "500" width = "400"/>


Be sure to add these two to your info.plist or you will surely receive an error.

"NSCameraUsageDescription" with a string of what ever you like

"NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription" with a string of what ever you like

"NSMicrophoneUsageDescription" with a string of whatever you like
<br/>
<img src="image4.png" style="height: 300px; width: 100px;" />



<br/>
<br />


This is the error you will receive.
<br/>
<img src="image3.png" style="height: 300px; width: 100px;" />
